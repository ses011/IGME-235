        <h1>Q-bitz</h1>
        <hr>

        <h2>I. Concept</h2>
        <p>Inspired by a board game of the same name, use patterned dice to recreate a given design.</p>
        <hr>
        
        <h2>II. Genre</h2>
        <p>Casual dice puzzle game</p>
        <hr>

        <h2>III. Platform</h2>
        <p>Mobile-friendly: works best on desktop, but functional on mobile or tablet</p>
        <hr>

        <h2>IV. Story</h2>
        <p>Completely abstract, just a puzzle game.</p>
        <hr>

        <h2>V. Aesthetics</h2>
        <p>Graphics - Simple but abstract. Patterns on dice include a singular circle, diagonal color split, and solid colors.<br>
            Sound - Sound effect when dice are rolled and placed in the puzzle.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h2>VI. Gameplay</h2>
        <p>Each dice will be able to be dragged with holding the mouse (Desktop) or the same with a finger (mobile).
            Tapping on a dice will roll it, as well as a "roll" button to roll all dice not in the puzzle yet.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h2>VII. Screenshots</h2>

        <h2>VII. Other</h2>
        <p>This will use similar base mechanics as the magnetic poetry assignment with an additional mouse event handler, different graphics, and a handler to check accuracy when the grid has been filled in.
            My current idea for the logic is each dice will be a Dice object, with a pattern and optional orientation property. There will be a set of pre-created prompts, but if I have time generating them randomly 
            based on possible dice orientations could be cool.
        </p>
