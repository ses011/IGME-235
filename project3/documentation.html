    <h1>Documentation</h1>
    <p>This is inspired by a table top game that I've played for years, Q-Bitz. It's a puzzle game that uses dice as the puzzle pices, and usually is played race-style against up to 3 other players. 
        This online version is a lot more casual than how my family plays it, but it has the base mechanics nonetheless. Each dice is an instance of the Dice class, which holds information about which 
        face is visible and which HTML element it refers to. When a dice is double clicked, it cycles through to the next value of a faces object literal being used like an enumerated type. There's another 
        object literal list of length 16 arrays that hold a collection of patterns. When the page is (re)loaded it randomly picks a pattern. <br>
        When a dice is moved the code checks if it is in a tray position, and gives it the value of said position. It then checks each position in the tray to see if it's full and the dice in that position 
        matches what should be there on the pattern. Adding more patterns is very easy which is good if I decide to expand on this, and it also has the potental for randomly-generated patterns as well. I definitely started with the code then slowly designed visually from there. Honestly getting the CSS to look not-terrible 
        was the hardest part. It still doens't look great but it's not bad. Snapping into place wasn't bad once I found the method to get the pixel position of an HTML element, sound and tutorial took me a half hour 
        combined, and I was able to use the patterns from the game cards I own as inspiration (I copied them) so all I had to do was create the individual dice face images in color and black and white. I originally 
        had the double click randomly display a face, as if you were rolling the dice, but after critique day having it cycle through the patterns was the top suggestion so I changed it. I also didn't get it to work on mobile, but it works well on multiple sizes of desktop browsers.<br>
        I wish the sound only played when the user drags and drops, rather than playing twice on double click, but I couldn't figure that out.
