    <p id="info">This game is inspired by a table top dice puzzle game called Q-Bitz. A design is displayed in the top left of your screen. Your goal is to match the colored tiles on the right 
        with that pattern. These tiles represent the dice. Double clicking on any will result in it's design changing. Continual clicking will cycle
        through all potential designs.
