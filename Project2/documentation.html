    <h1>Documentation</h1>
    <p>I used the Trivia API to make a quiz-type interaction where the user can choose how many questions, what category those questions are, and
        what type (multiple choice or T/F) of question. The process was fairly simple with no major roadblocks. Getting the questions formatted was definitely
        the longest part, but it wasn't super difficult. Figuring out how to change the 
        text color of the selected answer took a while. It wasn't a difficult answer, but finding the correct answer online took a lot of searching. 
        I originally planned to have the border around the question be what changed color, but I realized that changing the text could be easier and 
        I'm happy with how it turned out. I also used the fairly new CSS Nesting, which I personally think is easier to manage than normal CSS. No 
        it's not the same thing as SCSS, but it's a similar concept just supported by most browsers by default. I tested on desktop Edge, Safari on mobile,
        and both desktop and mobile for FireFox and Chrome, and they all worked as expected. <br><br>
        
        If the user requests more questions too quickly the API does sent a 429 (too many requests) error to console, but the user is shown a message to wait 
        a few seconds and it doesn't cause the whole project to crash. <br><br>

        Overall I think I did what was necessary and also went beyond with the color changing responses for the questions.
