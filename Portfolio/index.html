            <p>This is a collection consisting of mostly class assignments that I've done over the past year. All are individual projects unless noted otherwise. Some projects are still in progress, as is this site. More projects will be added as I finish them and have time to add them.</p>

                <h2>VR Cinematic Sandbox</h2>
                <p>The first of three VR projects for FRNT-489 "VR Storytelling". This was made in Unreal 5.2 and 5.3 using assets from the <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/stylized-fantasy-provencal">Stylized Fantasy Provencal</a> asset pack on the Epic Games launcher.
                        A Cinematic Sandbox is something where you as the player don't have to do much in order to get the story to play out infront of you. You walk around, maybe move a couple things when told, but it's one of the more passive types of experiences.</p>

                <h2>Frog Food</h2>
                <p>This was one of the first large JavaScript projects I've done. I had to create a "collector" (the frog) class, that could pick up and drop items that were randomly on the screen, but only one at a time. </p>
